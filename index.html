             Developed an embedded control unit for a tethered quaddrupel drone, housing a ARM Cortex M0 CPU and no floating point unit. Drone used onboard sensors to feed the control algorithm. 
            Developed a UART Protocol for communication as well as a PC interface for sending commands to the drone and reading the joystick.
            Achieved:
            <ul>
              <li>
                Control algorithm worked in fixed point, with conversions to floating point to perform FP-hacks for square root and power operatinos.
              </li>
              <li>
                150 Hz control loop.
              </li>
              <li>
                Robust communication protocol with CRC.
              </li>
              <li>
                Full TUI for pilot, including dashboards for angles, motor values and current state.
                Concurrent controls for handling joystick, mouse and UI inputs.

            Competed and won in a hackathon for Lely, an agricultural automation company.
            Combined 4 different data streams to create a milk health dashboard and give farmers a general view of their heard's health by comparing it to other heards in the database.
            Jury chose my solution based on its focus on the end customer (farmers) and providing a service no competitor offered.
